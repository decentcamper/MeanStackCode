<p>With <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, you can build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the worldâ€™s most popular front-end component library.</p>
<p>Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.</p>
<h2 id="adding-bootstrap-as-a-dependency">Adding Bootstrap As a Dependency:</h2>
<pre><code>npm install bootstrap --save
</code></pre>
<p>This would add bootstrap as a dependency to the node_modules and would also make an entry in the package.json which tracks our dependencies.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the angular-cli.json located in the root of the project</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In this array make an entry for the bootstrap.css.</p>
</li>
