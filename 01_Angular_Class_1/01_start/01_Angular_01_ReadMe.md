  So we learned what Angular is.
 
 
  But you might have also heard there is Angular 4 to Anugular five angular one or angular dot. J.S. So what are all these words about.
  
  
  No worries.
  
  
  It is way less confusing than it looks here.


  Angular five currently is the latest version.
  
  
  And in this course you're going to learn the latest angular syntax.
  
  
  Also because a single or five didn't introduce any breaking changes compared to angular.js.
  
  
  For now angular to an angular one also referred to as a Angular dot. J.S. that's a different thing.
  
  
  Angular2 back in time was a complete rewrite of angular JS which is now referred to as angular one.
  
  
  So we have two different frameworks.
  

  
  
  We should just call it angular and angular.js which is angular1.
  
  
  This course is about angular2 the orange part the right side of the slight angular to was the first release of angular and they now regularly release new versions.
  
  
  So we had angular four angle three was skipped for some work and conflict's And now we have angular five.
  
  
  That's the latest question of Angler right now and has already set in this course.
  
  
  You're going to learn the latest angular syntax.
  
  
  That's the important thing to take away.
  
  
  We have these big words in numbers 2 4 5 but actually these versions don't differ that much.


  Most of the time we only have minor changes and actually since angle two both angular four and angular
  

  Five didn't introduce any braking changes or anything like that.
  

  If you had an Angular2 app right now you could still easily upgraded to angular 5.
  

  So there is no reason to be super confused or worried.
  
  
  We have two major world it's angular and angular shapes and angle or five simply the latest version
  
  
  of angular and you're going to learn the latest code in this course.
